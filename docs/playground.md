# Playground

The [`dstackai/dstack-playground`](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack-playground) repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating how to use `dstack`.

The easiest method to interact with it is by opening it in Gitpod, which will automatically install `dstack`
and set up the environment.

[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/dstackai/dstack-playground){ class="md-go-to-action primary gitpod" }

If you'd like to run the examples on your own machine, follow these instructions:
