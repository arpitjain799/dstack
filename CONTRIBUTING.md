## Contributing process

1. Look for an existing issue or create a new one.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Open a PR. [Link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.

## Making changes

We use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to format Python code, so before committing your changes, run `black cli`. There is a [helper pre-commit installed](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/source_version_control.html) that makes commits fail if the code is not formatted. It also formats the code so that you can review the changes and commit again.

## P.S.

Feel free to open an issue if you have difficulties contributing to `dstack`.
